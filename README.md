# Project 2: Digital Agency (HYF)

## SYBEJA - Creative agency

By Sybren De Boever and Jamie-Lee Hart

For this assignment we had to create a website in group for a digital agency. Our digital agency got the name SYBEJA. This stands for the 2 first letters of our names. 

SYBEJA does not only create websites, but also grows your business through various marketing techniques and growth strategies. 

**Technical Requirements:**

- For this assignment we used a static site generator called 11ty.
- For styling we used CSS preprocessor (SASS).
- We also used a UI-framework more specifically Bootstrap 5.
