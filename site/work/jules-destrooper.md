about: Jules Destrooper's biscuits. Who doesn't melt for it? The batter for the successful brand was already beaten in 1886, when Destrooper started a bakery slash spice business in Lo, West Flanders. He made almond bread from his spices that he gave to his customers. An idea that rose and rose and the rest is history.

## The assignment

Look, if the cream of the cookie makers asks you to optimize its website, webshop and sales flow, then you are ready to eat. A job for gourmets who especially do not over brown: Sybeja should succeed with a tasty pun. From the digital transformation box, the new concept, target groups, channels and objectives were focused.

## Non-stop webshop

Nice story and what a brand, but you want cookies, no hassle. Too much friction on the customer journey and the customer loses his way. Fluently and without detours, that was the aim for Sybeja. Because whether you are a private individual, company or association, switching quickly and top of mind is the ABC of B2B or B2C for us. Jules Destrooper wanted a webshop where you can't just pick the cookies out of your screen and put them on your wish list otherwise. Click, crack, done.

## Recipe for pure success

The Jules Destrooper brand is rock solid. Otherwise you will not become a purveyor to the court. You don't just give his website a new look. With respect for the well-known style, we have carefully considered the information architecture: a generous extra color, custom buttons with appropriate icons, oven-fresh mood photography to enhance the experience and unadulterated communication about the purity of the raw materials, the presence of allergens, etc. If you like a chunk of history, you can scroll through the history of the brand via the animated timeline and - this can really count - thanks to our smart quantity calculator you can get started with the online recipes yourself.

**Pastry baking is precision work. Then we build a tool you can count on. Choose a recipe, enter the number of people and the calculator will adjust the quantities.**

## A clear line from front to back end
In 1886, they may still have done it that way, but orders cannot be taken manually anymore today. There must be a system behind it that processes orders and quotations just as smoothly as biscuits roll off the conveyor. The Craft developed a CRM sales tool with a front and back end section. On the one hand, the customer logs in via his dashboard and can monitor his quotation, order, personalizations and delivery options. On the other hand, the sales manager gets a nice overview and passes everything neatly to production. Many parameters determine the final price. The challenge here was to develop a configurator tool that takes into account the countless possibilities in terms of offer, personalization, delivery, discounts ... For B2B and B2V customers, the price is visible as soon as they have been approved.

> A sales flow has to flow, and so Sybeja draws it smoothly with a sales and configurator tool from the quotation basket and / or order basket.
