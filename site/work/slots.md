## The assignment 

A website and webshop of thirteen in a dozen, Slots and Sybeja are too unique for that. It is up to us to pour the heart and soul of the customer into a promotional web context: a shop with room layouts and sophisticated filter options, a 'shop by look' that puts Slots in the customer's shoes, and a handsome virtual showroom of 360 ° that completes the circle of the total experience. Customization meets excellent customization.
**A website as a calling card for unique total projects, a webshop for interior that really comes in, customization where quality is the measure.**

## Digital, by nature

Online shopping has never been so easy and tempting with extensive filters on brand, color, price, material… The photography and projects exude pure craftsmanship. Inspiring examples invite you to work on customization in clear steps. Class, simplicity and authenticity, but digitally translated: Sybeja knows its customers.

## The customer journey starts here

Building a web environment, not as the end but as the starting point of a long-term partnership: this could be the beginning of a beautiful partnership. Sybeja looks further and sees a link between the products and shops on Facebook and Instagram, the ideal medium for mood photography. Dropping a newsletter every now and then keeps the customer and the atmosphere in it: we create the appropriate template for this.

## Sales flow

Also in the pipeline: a link with an ERP package for the digital sales flow for online orders. And unique customer, unique times: Sybeja links the choice of your pick-up time to an online agenda in times of corona.

> Sybeja creates the right atmosphere in a mood of successful co-creation and comes full circle with a virtual buying experience in 360 °.
