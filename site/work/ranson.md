## The assignment 

At Ranson Group, 90 percent of customers ordered the traditional way - by telephone, e-mail, fax or sales manager; only 10 percent via the existing online webshop. Ranson's goal: to double the number of online orders in 1 year. Assignment for The Craft: thoroughly renew the Ranson b2b webshop. Obvious conditions: every customer must be able to choose from more than 33,000 products in no time and must be able to place his order super smoothly. Interesting detail: each customer receives a tailor-made price setting, depending on his purchase and sector. The Ranson shop thus became a real example of a high-performance B2B webshop.

## Let's talk first

Sybeja received carte blanche from Ranson Group to renew the existing b2b webshop. Because we believe perfect output starts with solid input, we made site visits to end users. We carefully observed how bakers used the existing webshop, listened to what was wrong and what was wrong and drew up a list with all user wishes and needs, down to the smallest details. You asked for the possibility to print best buy products in a handy list or to give ordered products a recognizable color? The Sybeja did it!

## Smart selection in the B2B webshop

Ranson Group manages its stock via the ERP package (Enterprise Resource Planning) AX Dynamics from Microsoft. Sybeja provided a smart selection of data from that abundance of stock information. Only what is relevant for the webshop user was allowed to be shown and processed. The complex pricing policy was also flawlessly tackled by Sybeja. After all, Ranson Group has a unique price setting per customer. The new webshop from Sybeja takes care of the pricing and presents each customer fully automatically 'his' price.

## Update is ready (x2)

Server updates happen twice a day. Before 6 am, all essential info for webshop users is imported: orders and invoices, new prices and products. At the start of the working day, online customers will find everything they need to order. A second import, of non-essential information, takes place at 11 pm, when internet traffic decreases. Orders are sent back to the Ranson ERP package in real time.

## It's fast, or not at all

Searching in 33,000 ingredients: that could be a recipe for disaster. Thanks to the integration of the lightning-fast external search engine Algolia, frustratingly long waiting times are a thing of the past. Webshop users can search super fast. In barely 50 milliseconds you will be presented exactly what you are looking for. Btw: 50 thousandth of a second, that is the speed at which the Lamborghini Aventador shifts.

## Predicting ordering with this B2B webshop

The Craft rigorously applied machine learning to the data, so that the webshop can accurately predict what customers want to order. Non-relevant products and ingredients are carefully filtered out. Search is also interactive: the category structure of products and ingredients changes depending on the search term entered in the search bar. This interactive, smart layout saves surfers a lot of time.

## The result: a high-performance B2B website and webshop

Ranson Group not only promises customers the best products, but also excellent service: super-smooth ordering options and lightning-fast deliveries.

Sybeja helped the company deliver on that promise. After 6 months, online sales of Ranson Group have increased by 15 percent. This is the result of the ease of use of the new webshop itself and the sophisticated online marketing of the b2b webshop.

The sales managers had to invest less time in taking orders and were given time again for their core business: presenting the latest products and promotions during on-site visits. In this way, Ranson Group can continue to grow.
