## The assignment

At The Sybeja we like to work with a good cause. In the case of Hachiko, this meant creating a new website with the option of donating gifts and making their administration smoother.

## The eye also wants something: a refresh of the web design

The start: a refresh of the look & feel. And that based on the new corporate identity created by our offline partner Vandekerckhove & Devos. We translated this new style into a web design. We also paid a lot of attention to integrating photos, an important part of Hachiko's content. The new Hachiko website. Easy to visit via desktop, tablet and smartphone.

## Information architecture: clear content

The different categories of assistance dogs, target groups and testimonials created the need to establish a thoughtful information architecture. And that even before we started with the web design and programming of the website. This allowed us to program the website efficiently in the flexible Sybeja CMS.

The information architecture, a strategy that we use in every new project, forces us to think about how we will place and visualize the content in the website. Based on the goals of the website and established customer journeys, we consider which information is where. And how a visitor can easily find the answer to his or her question.

By following this strategy, the design and development respond to current online marketing techniques. In this way, the website is ready to improve its performance in the long term from the moment it goes live. Most adjustments in function of marketing purposes are thus already avoided, so that we work efficiently (both cost and time).

## Make an online donation: simple!

However, Hachiko's website is not just an information platform. A visitor must also be able to easily make an online gift.

For our developers it was no problem to build a gift module in Craft CMS. We let the settlement of the payments be carried out by online party Mollie.

## Make a donation: GDPR Proof

During the programming, we also took GDPR into account, the European legislation that regulates the use of visitor data, among other things. For example, personal data is not automatically used to send the Hachiko magazine. If you enter an amount equal to or greater than â‚¬ 20, you will automatically receive an extra option to check that you want to receive the Hachiko magazine. As a website visitor, you will only receive what you have chosen on the mail!

## Make a donation: overview of tax certificates

Because a donation also entitles you to a tax certificate, it is useful for the non-profit organization to quickly get an overview of who is entitled to this. That is why we built a report in the CMS that collects all the data that Hachiko's administration needs and makes it downloadable. Useful!
