## The assignement

We wouldn't be Sybeja if we didn't develop a personal relationship with our customers. And Huysman Bouw is such a customer. We grow together with them and in the meantime have developed a long lasting bond of trust. That's how we first built their website. This had to exude the family and homely atmosphere of Huysman Bouw, but at the same time also bring the housing projects to the interested buyer. But for this customer we go further. Because we continue to maintain and adjust the website when necessary. We also bring in ideas ourselves to stimulate user-friendliness and the collection of leads.

## Let the visitor find what they are looking for

A crucial assignment for the Huysman Bouw website is to let a visitor quickly find what he or she is looking for. That is why we built a handy search function with filters. That way, someone can quickly perform a search and find an interesting housing project. We also made the overview of the housing projects clear. In addition to the visual thumbs, USPs can also be added here: short messages that catch the eye and can convince a potential lead to discover a housing project.

## Easy to contact

What should a visitor do if he is interested in a housing project on this website? Contact us of course! An analysis of heat mapping and Google Analytics combined with our experience in copywriting and interactive design ensure that we ensure that conversion runs smoothly.

Shorten the step to contact us? We solved this by linking a sympathetic photo of the responsible construction consultant to the form and telephone number. This way the visitor immediately knows who he is dealing with.

But what if there are now several construction consultants per housing project? We solved that too. We alternately show the contact details and photos of the construction consultants. For example, there is no discussion about the distribution of incoming leads. Incidentally, the processing of those incoming leads also runs smoothly. Because we link them to the right mailbox or online tool. We automatically create a mailing list in Campaign Monitor.

## Newsletters: connect your audience with your company

Sending newsletters is one of this customer's online marketing strategies. Rightly so! Because many visitors to the website want to stay informed of the housing projects that are still under development. Sending a newsletter to this type of target audience means addressing a large group of people in one efficient way. And that while you know that that group of users is already interested. It is therefore not illogical that the conversion rate of such newsletters is high!

## SEO: ensure that people find the website

The assignment was to improve the online visibility of this website in the long term and support the current Google AdWords campaigns. We set up our SEO strategy for this website in two ways: aimed at a broader and more general target audience, but also aimed at stimulating local findability.

Responding to the logarithms of Google and Bing, we fully optimized this website. We aimed the main pages at a broader target audience that works with more general search queries.

In the meantime, we are still monitoring the online visibility of the website. A / B testing, maintaining heat maps and monitoring keyword rankings ensure that we constantly have the necessary data to add improvements. These updates are, in addition to increasing the position in the search engines, also aimed at improving the user-friendliness of the website.

An example? That was testing the position of the form on the contact page. Do we place it on the left or right of the page? With or without header photo? Google Analytics data gave us an insight into which position of the contact form gives the highest conversion rate. A small adjustment that produces more leads. It's often in the details!

## Landing pages

Huysman Bouw develops housing projects in certain regions. A landing page with the theme real estate and real estate in such a region is then the solution to attract the relevant target audience. The content and design work together here to guide visitors to the specific housing projects. The strategic placing of call to actions in turn creates new leads. We improve the online findability of these landing pages by basing the copywriting and optimization (seo) on keyword research.

> Sybeja has helped a lot to optimize the specific project pages. After all, region-specific housing projects are proposed there.
