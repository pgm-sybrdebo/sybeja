## The assignement 

With their Power Flowers app, IBC makes it possible to create recipes with dyes. It is important that you only develop recipes with the app that meet the legal nutritional provisions.

## Flexibility with conditions
The Power Flowers app does what it should. Via this app you can easily choose and combine dyes in order to find out the correct product quantities. The color library and instructional videos will put you on the right track. In the end, checking against food legislation ensures that your creation meets all requirements and is safe to use.

## Customize an app? As easy as a website!

We have made customizing the app so user-friendly that IBC employees can do this themselves. After all, we programmed the app in our beloved Sybeja CMS, with which we also build our websites and web shops.

## Keeping data?

Google Analytics tells you everything.
We also added Google Analytics and programmed the correct events in the app. In this way we keep track of which app users click where. Which colors are often used? Which videos are being watched? Measuring is knowing. And with the collection of this data, the app and the product itself can continuously improve.

> Sybeja makes adding content or replacing images in an app just as easy and fast as with a website.
